# 3. The eInvoicing Interoperability framework

The Framework aims is to provide certainty on how a prescribed set of established open standards can be used to extend eInvoicing to all Australian businesses, minimise the cost of implementation for software providers and enhance business interactions (especially for micro to small businesses) by making invoicing an automatic digital interaction. 

## 3.1 What is it

The Council’s Interoperability Framework is based on the concept of standardising interconnections around what is called a ‘four corner model’. Similar models have emerged from the financial sector (for inter-bank interoperability), telecommunications sector (for global roaming) and are already being used in many countries for eInvoicing. In Australia, the superannuation sector (via Superstream) also uses a standardised form of the ‘four corner model’. 

Under this logical model, businesses can send messages : 
 - directly to each other by implementing their own Access Points (without intermediaries); 
 - via a mutual 3rd party Access Point (3-corners); or 
 - via two independent external service providers (4-corners). 

As the digital economy grows, the trend is toward the increased use of 4-corner models. However, as with rail networks, telephony systems and other communication technologies, unless standards are introduced, complex and expensive interconnections are required to connect all existing participants. The DBC Framework has proposed standards for the creation of an ‘open’ 4-corner model. 

A key requirement for the eInvoicing Interoperability Framework is that a Buyer’s or Supplier’s digital address and digital capabilities may change over time. The associated challenge with using an ‘open’ 4-corner model is finding out what businesses are reachable and what their digital capabilities are. The Framework resolves this by establishing a business discovery service. The idea of using the 4-corner model with business discovery is a well-established and an internationally accepted solution, and an extension to the existing Superstream model.

The actors involved in eInvoicing are: 

**Buyers:** The Buyer is the legal person or organisation who purchases goods or services;

**Suppliers:** The Supplier is the legal person or organisation who provides a good or service;

**Access Point:** A service (in-house or outsourced) that sends and receives eInvoices and passes them on to the respective participants;

**Digital Capability Locator:** A service for looking up the location of the Digital Capability Publisher for a Buyer or Supplier; and

**Digital Capability Publishers:** Providers of a service for Buyers and Suppliers to store details of their capabilities, and includes what scenarios they can process, the data formats they support and the delivery address for their eInvoices.

eInvoicing using the Framework means that the business applications of the Suppliers and Buyers (corners one and four) do not exchange invoices directly with each other but via Access Points (corners two and three). Any organisation (such as a Buyer or Supplier) has the choice of using a third party service provider to provide an Access Point or to implement their own.

Finally, the meaning of the information in eInvoices needs to be understood by all Buyers and Suppliers regardless of the natural business systems they use, so an agreed set of information elements in a standardised data format is required for exchanges between Access Points.

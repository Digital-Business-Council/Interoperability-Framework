# 3. The eInvoicing Interoperability framework

The Framework aims is to provide certainty on how a prescribed set of established open standards can be used to extend eInvoicing to all Australian businesses, minimise the cost of implementation for software providers and enhance business interactions (especially for micro to small businesses) by making invoicing an automatic digital interaction. 

## 3.1 What is it

The Council’s Interoperability Framework is based on the concept of standardising interconnections around what is called a ‘four corner model’. Similar models have emerged from the financial sector (for inter-bank interoperability), telecommunications sector (for global roaming) and are already being used in many countries for eInvoicing. In Australia, the superannuation sector (via Superstream) also uses a standardised form of the ‘four corner model’. 

Under this logical model, businesses can send messages : 
 - directly to each other by implementing their own Access Points (without intermediaries); 
 - via a mutual 3rd party Access Point (3-corners); or 
 - via two independent external service providers (4-corners). 

As the digital economy grows, the trend is toward the increased use of 4-corner models. However, as with rail networks, telephony systems and other communication technologies, unless standards are introduced, complex and expensive interconnections are required to connect all existing participants. The DBC Framework has proposed standards for the creation of an ‘open’ 4-corner model. 

A key requirement for the eInvoicing Interoperability Framework is that a Buyer’s or Supplier’s digital address and digital capabilities may change over time. The associated challenge with using an ‘open’ 4-corner model is finding out what businesses are reachable and what their digital capabilities are. The Framework resolves this by establishing a business discovery service. The idea of using the 4-corner model with business discovery is a well-established and an internationally accepted solution, and an extension to the existing Superstream model.

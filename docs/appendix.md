##10.1 Design principles for eInvoicing 

This document describes the Council endorsed design principles that informed the development of this eInvoicing Interoperability framework (eIFW).

| --- |------- |
**Principle 1: Extensibility** | **Select standards that will not inhibit the future extension of the eIFW to other elements of the procure-to-pay process.**| 
Rationale | • The goal of implementing the eIFW is to help bridge ‘islands of trade’ in order to reduce the cost of doing business.|
|  |  • Savings to the economy will accrue due to increased automation and the reduction of error prone paper based processing of invoices.|
| |• The success of the interoperability framework is measured by the rates of straight through processing and conformance with the standards, as well as the value of savings and improved experience of Australian businesses, particularly the SME market. |
Implications | • The design of the interoperability framework would need to be balanced between focussing on immediate implementation of process automation in the accounts payable stages and strategically strategic alignment to the end to end procure to pay process lifecycle, post the procurement award stages.| 
| |• The standards should be designed to facilitate automation of common processes between buyers and sellers. |
**Principle 2: Nonproprietary**|**Choose standards that are open, royalty free and vendor agnostic.**|
Rationale | • The standards should be able to be freely adopted, implemented and extended.|
| | • Avoid lock in to a particular proprietary solution and thereby minimise the cost of adoption for parties involved. |
| | • Avoid exclusion of a particular market segment. |
Implications |• In deciding the use of open standards, existing levels of take-up across all domains and availability of implementations of these standards will be considered to prevent use of poorly supported open standards. |
| |• The framework will need to be attractive to the business community and all of government will adopt the interoperability framework. |
| |• Businesses will have free choice of the technology and providers for software and services. |
**Principle 3: Existing standards alignment**|**Align with relevant and established international standards. Adopt Australian standards and practices only where international standards are not applicable. Do not modify any standard, international or Australian, other than as a last resort.**|
Rationale |• There are various parts to a likely framework that have been successfully proven locally and internationally. Reuse of these proven standards will improve the likelihood of adoption and reduce risk. |
| |• There are most likely proven integration approaches between pre-existing standards.|
| |• Irrespective of whether the initial scope includes payments or not some businesses may choose to implement the full procure-to-pay lifecycle which includes payments. Alignment with the new payments platform (NPP) will reduce the burden on the software industry. |

#4. Technical Specifications 

##4.1 Summary of Services 

This chapter provides more information on the technical specifications underpinning the Interoperability Framework components. The approach employed by the Framework is to promote the use of existing technical specifications and standards rather than to define new ones. The profiling work of Superstream, the European e-SENS project, CEN TC434 and BII Workshop as well as the OpenPEPPOL community have been evaluated as part of the Councilâ€™s implementation of these services.

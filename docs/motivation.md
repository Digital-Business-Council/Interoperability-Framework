#2. Motivation 

Considering the objectives of all stakeholders involved, with a special focus on SMEs, this industry lead initiative paves the way for a broad scale, whole of economy adoption of eInvoicing (and other digital business processes). 

By initially enabling simpler and more efficient access to eInvoicing through the adoption of a coherent framework, it is anticipated that the benefits derived would extend well beyond the current participants and to the broader economy (Government included). This is particularly important for small and medium sized businesses for which the benefits of adopting full eInvoicing have been unclear and costs have been prohibitive. 

##2.1 Business benefits: 

 - Business processes would be further streamlined and enhanced through the automated data exchange and end to end processing of the invoice; 
 - Enhanced system and commoditised systems for reliably delivering and receiving invoices (and in the future the full ‘procure to pay’ cycle) by digital interaction would result in lower costs, replacing manual process and hard copy interchange; 
 - Overall procurement costs to buyers would reduce by increasing competition and diffusing the current state of oligopoly from the market (Billentis, 2015); 
 - The option to use a single Access Point for all digital transactions would reduce the costs to suppliers and/or buyers; 
 - Buyers and Suppliers would be able to trade with a wider pool of digitally enabled trading partners and participate in a more competitive network; and 
 - Businesses would be enabled to assess the benefits adopting eInvoicing to achieve the potential 60-80% efficiency gain (Billentis, 2015) against the status quo; and 
 - Overall efficiencies would lead to improved Buyer/Supplier relationships.

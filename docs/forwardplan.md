#7. Forward plan 

This initial release of the Framework mainly covers: 

1. a set of common standards between the Access Points in a four corner network model, including business discovery; and 
2. the Invoicing (including adjustments) and Recipient Created Tax Invoicing business processes. 

Once the initial release of the framework is completed the Council expects to continue its work to additionally cover: 

 - other business processes which includes remittance advices and payments (in collaboration with the work progressing under the New Payments Platform); 
 - the message structures to support the additional business processes; 
 - message delivery standards to support corners 1 and 4 to enable businesses to provide businesses ease of migration between Access Points; 
 - enhanced business discovery; 
 - service provider reporting; and 
 - additional security features such as optionally providing message confidentiality between Access Points 1 and 4.
